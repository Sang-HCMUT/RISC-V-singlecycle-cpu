# RISC-V Single-Cycle CPU (RV32I)

This project implements a 32-bit single-cycle CPU based on the RISC-V RV32I instruction set architecture. It was developed for the EE3043 Computer Architecture course.

## üß† Features

- Implements the RV32I instruction set (excluding FENCE)
- Single-cycle datapath
- Peripherals supported:
  - LEDs, Switches (required)
  - LCD, 7-segment displays (optional)
- Two separate memory modules:
  - ROM for instruction memory
  - RAM for data memory and peripherals

## üß™ Simulation

Testbenches are provided in the `sim/` directory. Run simulations using tools like ModelSim, Verilator, or Quartus.

## üñ•Ô∏è Target Platform

- DE2 Board (Cyclone II EP2C35F672C6)
